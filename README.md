# Go Concurrency Exercises [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mindworker/go-concurrency-exercises.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mindworker/go-concurrency-exercises) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mindworker/go-concurrency-exercises)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mindworker/go-concurrency-exercises)
Exercises for Golang's concurrency patterns.

## Why
The Go community has plenty resources to read about go's concurrency model and how to use it effectively. But *who actually wants to read all this*!? This repo tries to teach concurrency patterns by following the 'learning by doing' approach.

## How to take this challenge
1. *Only edit `main.go`* to solve the problem. Do not touch any of the other files.
2. If you find a `*_test.go` file, you can test the correctness of your solution with `go test`
3. If you get stuck, join us on [Slack](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/)! I'm sure there will be people who are happy to give you some code review (if not, find me via @beertocode ;) )
